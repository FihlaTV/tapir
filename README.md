### Tapir includes four modules: ###

1. **Tapir Captain** is a network sniffer for traffic capturing and parsing.
2. **Tapir Salto** aggregates traffic from **Captain** and stores it to DB-engine.
3. **Tapir Twig** provides REST API for **Hoof** to get data from the database.
4. **Tapir Hoof** is a convenient and easy web-based user interface to search and display call data.

**Captain** can capture data directly from the network interface (UDP/TCP/encapsulated IP2IP), from a single PCAP file or check a directory for new incoming data files to process.

**Salto** receives parsed data from **Captain**, validates its structure and stores extracted data in the database. The **Salto** can be easily scaled to achieve the desired performance. 

**Twig** offers REST API for user interface queries and presents statistical data.

**Hoof** includes dashboard with widgets and SIP search page. Each call can be displayed as a graphic callflow and a raw message view. There's an option for pcap-file export as well. 

**Tapir** modules are powered by high-performance Java code. It uses fast and reliable MongoDB database for the signaling data. So scaling of any module is just clear. There's also Redis cache to store and access statistical metrics for instant operation on them. 
**Tapir Hoof** is based on ReactJS which provides a simple way to create custom web interface.

**Tapir** solution is to be used by telecom operators and service providers, who aims the excellent service quality. **Tapir** provides fast search 
and significant time savings in problems solving for trunk and access connections. 
**Tapir** minimizes time to detect and resolve of network issues and customer problems.
