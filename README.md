### Tapir includes four modules: ###

1. **Tapir Captain** network sniffer for capturing and parsing traffic.
2. **Tapir Salto** aggregates traffic from **Captain** and stores it to DB-engine.
3. **Tapir Twig** provides REST API for **Hoof** to get data from database.
4. **Tapir Hoof** convenient and easy web-based user interface to search and display call data.

**Captain** can capture data directly from network interface (UDP/TCP/encapsulated IP2IP), from single file 
or check directory for new incoming file and process it.

**Salto** receives parsed data from **Captain**, validates it structure and stores the data in database. 
Of course, to achieve the desired performance can be easily scaled. 

**Twig** offers REST API for user interface queries and presents statistical data.

**Hoof** includes dashboard with widgets and SIP search page. Each call can be displayed as graphic callflow, 
raw message view or can be exported to pcap-file.

**Tapir** modules powered by high-performance Java code and use fast and reliable MongoDB database for signaling data. 
So scaling of any module will be just clear. Redis is used for storing statistical metrics and operating on it. 
**Tapir Hoof** based on ReactJS which provides simple way for creating custom web interfaces.

**Tapir** solution used by telecom operators and service providers, who note the excellent stability, fast search 
and significant time savings in solving problems on trunk and access connections.
